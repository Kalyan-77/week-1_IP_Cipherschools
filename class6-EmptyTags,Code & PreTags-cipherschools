   HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be 
   <nbsp></nbsp>
   embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such
    as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
    Tags such as img and input  directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p surround and provide 
    information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use 
    them to interpret the content of the page.</pre>
